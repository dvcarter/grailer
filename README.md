# grailer

## What is this?
Grailer is a project that allows a user to scrape data from [Grailed](https://grailed.com). Grailed is an after-retail marketplace for
users to purchase & sell fashion items.

__Disclaimer: None of the data being scraped using this tool should be used for commercial purposes. This project is motivated entirely by my personal interest in both fashion and technology.__

## Motivation
To my knowledge, Grailed currently does not offer a public API for its site yet.

## Technologies used
  - [Grailed Website](https://grailed.com)
  - [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) for browser automation
  - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for basic analysis on datasets
  - [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for HTML parsing
